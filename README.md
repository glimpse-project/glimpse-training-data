Large resources used for training the Glimpse motion capture system

*Note: we recommend passing --depth=1 while cloning considering the ~80MB size
of our .blend file and the large CMU mocap archives*

After cloning this repository you also need to run `./unpack.sh` to decompress
the CMU mocap archives and setup Blender as described below:


# Blender-based rendering pipeline

The `blender/` directory includes a glimpse-training.blend file for use in
conjunction with `addon/glimpse_data_generator` that helps us import the
CMU mocap animations into Blender and render our training images.


## Setup Blender automatically

After cloning this repository, then assuming you have Blender (2.79) installed
you can install and enable all of the required addons like so:

```
cd blender/
./install-addons.py
```

This will download and install the Makehuman BlenderTools addons (MakeTarget,
MakeWalk and MakeClothes) and update your Blender user preferences to add
glimpse-training-data/blender as a scripts directory so that Blender can find
the glimpse_data_generator addon.


## Setup Blender manually

Firstly, follow the instructions here to install the Makehuman BlenderTools addons:
http://www.makehumancommunity.org/wiki/Documentation:Getting_and_installing_BlenderTools

Within Blender's User Preferences -> File tab:

Point the 'Scripts:' entry to the glimpse-training-data/blender/ directory

Press 'Save User Settings' and quit and reopen Blender

Under User Preferences -> Addons now enable these Addons:

* Make Walk
* Make Clothes
* Make Target
* Glimpse Rig Paint
* Glimpse Training Data Generor


# CMU Motion captures

This mocap data originally comes from CMU at http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/

With the following permissive licensing terms:

```
This data is free for use in research projects.
You may include this data in commercially-sold products,
but you may not resell this data directly, even in converted form.
If you publish results obtained using this data, we would appreciate it
if you would send the citation to your published paper to jkh+mocap@cs.cmu.edu,
and also would add this text to your acknowledgments section:

  "The data used in this project was obtained from mocap.cs.cmu.edu.
  The database was created with funding from NSF EIA-0196217."
```

and this in their FAQ:

```
  Q. How can I use this data?
  A. The motion capture data may be copied, modified, or redistributed without
     permission. 
```

The files we're using contain a conversion of the original data to BVH format,
which were published at cgspeed.com and now archived here:
https://sites.google.com/a/cgspeed.com/cgspeed/motion-capture/cmu-bvh-conversion

Considering that the cgspeed files are hosted on mediaflare.com which requires
interaction with a browser to download, we commit the files to our repository
for convenience.

For reference, we also found that these files have been republished under
http://codewelt.com/cmumocap where it's also possible to download these files
non-interactively, but for downloading to Travis for CI (cached) we have better
bandwidth cloning from github.
